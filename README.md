## Algorithms

### Gaussian Elimination
Implementation of the Gaussian Elimination method for solving systems of linear equations.

### Jacobi Method
Implementation of the Jacobi iterative method for solving systems of linear equations.

### Gauss-Seidel Method
Implementation of the Gauss-Seidel iterative method for solving systems of linear equations.

### Power Method
Implementation of the Power Method for finding the dominant eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of a matrix.

### Least Squares Method
Implementation of the Least Squares method for finding the best-fitting solution to over-determined systems of linear equations.

### Gram-Schmidt Process
Implementation of the Gram-Schmidt process for orthogonalizing a set of vectors in an inner product space.

## Installation

To use these algorithms, you need to have Scilab installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Scilab website](https://www.scilab.org/).

## Usage

Each algorithm is located in a `.sci` file. To run an algorithm, open the `.sci` file in Scilab or execute it:

```scilab
exec('path_to_algorithm.sci');
```

Replace `path_to_algorithm.sci` with the path to the specific `.sci` file you want to run.
